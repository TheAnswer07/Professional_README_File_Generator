### Project Description
This Professional README file generator has as objective to make it accessible and easy to create a file in the Terminal that provides an overview of the project that’s being worked on. It offers different sections for text content, files and links to be added to it for a more complete description of the project. This was a fun project to work on but mainly very useful in terms of time saving and effective transmission of future projects’ highlights.
